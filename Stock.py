# This object will both collect and store stock information. These are the
# fields it will need:
#    - What is the stock's symbol? : Str
#    - What is the current price of the stock? : Float
#    - What does the stock pay as a dividend? : Float
#    - Would you like to reinvest your dividends? : Bool
#    - How much will you invest per paycheck towards this stock? : Float
#
# Add some functionality to calculate a range Â±25% the cost of the stock, and
# Â±15% dividend earnings.
